Legacy Responsive Web Training Tool for Developers

## Where it Started>
Somewhere between **2008 and 2010**, I created this responsive template and mini-grid
system as a starter kit for other developers to copy and use in their projects.

## Where it Went Next
At the time, responsive concepts were still new to many of us. This blueprint
quickly morphed into a training tool for the engineers on my team.

## Where it is Now
**This is not an example of modern UX development.**
This project is now used to demonstrate technical writing skills in an HTML format.
It also show smy decades-long commitment to documentation and developer advocacy.
